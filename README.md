# VSDI_MATLAB_COMPARISON

To run all of the methods on a specific experiment (We provided only 1 from all the 22), run the first section of "Real_data_comparison.m" file. 
The path to the .mat file needs to be provided in fname. 
** To get the same results as in the article, make sure the "paramsori.csv" file, which is a csv with all the user defined parameters for each experiment, is the same as Table2 in the supp. material.

To plot the figures from the provided results (outputs) after running all experiments: 
load output .mat file and then run the file plot_figures (need to load each output .mat file separately to matlab and then run)
Take note that there are results for the simulation and experimental data, and each figure is either for simulation or experimental so the appropriate results should be selected.
